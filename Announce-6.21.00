Hello,

I am pleased to announce that tcsh-6.21 is now available; this is a bug
fix release (after 2.5 years) with no new features.

Please consult the Fixes files for a complete list of changes.

Tcsh is an enhanced version of the Berkeley C-shell that offers command
line editing and completion plus many other little things that preserve
the length of your fingers.

Tcsh runs on most UNIX machines, as well as Windows

You can get tcsh from ftp://ftp.astron.com/pub/tcsh/tcsh-6.21.00.tar.gz
The latest source is on github: https://github.com/tcsh-org/tcsh

RMD160 (tcsh-6.21.00.tar.gz) = 665d522ded31e3fa23b71a5726d2d52e1c60e085

This is a gzip (GNU zip) tar archive. If you don't have GNU zip you can
get it from ftp.gnu.org or other GNU mirrors.

I would like to thank:

    * everyone who sent bug reports
    * the beta team for all their help, bug fixes, and suggestions

Best,

christos
